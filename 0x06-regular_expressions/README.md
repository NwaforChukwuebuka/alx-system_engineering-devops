# Regular Expression Project

This project focuses on leveraging regular expressions, showcasing the practical application of pattern matching in Ruby using the Oniguruma library.

## Learning Objectives

In this project, I gained proficiency in constructing and implementing regular expressions in Ruby. Each Ruby script within the project is designed to match specific patterns based on command-line arguments.
