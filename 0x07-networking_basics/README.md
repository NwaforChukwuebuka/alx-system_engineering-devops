# Networking Basics #0

This repository serves as the initial installment in a two-part series introducing fundamental networking concepts. Throughout this project, I delved into key topics, including the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, as well as the TCP/UDP data transfer protocols. The tasks encompassed quiz-like questions and the creation of bash scripts to reinforce practical understanding.

## Tasks Overview ðŸ“ƒ

### 0. OSI Model

**File:** [0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model)

This task involves answering questions related to the OSI model, a conceptual framework pivotal in understanding telecommunication systems. The responses cover the nature of the OSI model and its organizational structure.

### 1. Types of Network

**File:** [1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network)

This task explores various types of networks, ranging from LANs and WANs to the internet. The questions address the connectivity of Holberton iMacs, inter-office network connections, and the network used when browsing www.holbertonschool.com on a smartphone.

### 2. MAC and IP Address

**File:** [2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)

Here, I elucidate the concepts of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. The responses distinguish between MAC and IP addresses and outline their roles in network communication.

### 3. UDP and TCP

**File:** [3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)

This task involves interpreting an image provided by Holberton School to answer questions about UDP and TCP protocols. It focuses on the characteristics of data transfer and the inquiries a TCP worker might make.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports

**Script:** [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)

A bash script designed to display listening ports, providing information about sockets and the corresponding program names and PIDs associated with each port.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network

**Script:** [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)

A bash script that performs a ping test on an IP address received as an argument, sending five pings to determine the host's network availability.
