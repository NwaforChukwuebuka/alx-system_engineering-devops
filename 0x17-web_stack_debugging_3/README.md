Web Stack Debugging #3
Overview
This project is the fourth in a series of web stack debugging exercises. In these projects, I was provided with broken or bugged web stacks in isolated containers and tasked with restoring them to a functional state. For each task, I developed scripts to automate the necessary commands to resolve the issues.

Tasks
0. Strace is Your Friend
File: 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
Description: This Puppet manifest corrects a typo that causes a WordPress application, served by an Apache web server, to fail.
Usage:
bash
Copy code
puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
Usage
To apply the fix using the provided Puppet manifest, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
This command will execute the Puppet manifest, which automates the necessary steps to fix the web stack issue.
