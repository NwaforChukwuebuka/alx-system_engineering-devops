Firewall Configuration Project
In this project, I used the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to configure firewalls on my web servers.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
1. Block all incoming traffic but
1-block_all_incoming_traffic_but: This Bash script installs a UFW firewall and blocks all incoming traffic, except for ports 22, 443, and 80.

2. Port forwarding
100-port_forwarding: This UFW configuration file redirects traffic from port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP.
